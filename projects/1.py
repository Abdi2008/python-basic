# Project 1: Number Guessing Game ðŸ”¢
# Requirements:

# The program must generate a random integer between 1 and 50.

# The user should be prompted to enter their guess.

# After each guess, the program will tell the user if their guess is "Too high" or "Too low".

# If the user guesses the correct number, the program should print a success message like "Correct! You guessed it!" and then the game ends.

# Bonus: Keep track of the number of attempts it takes the user to guess the number and display it at the end.

# #     human_choice=int(input("Choose a number: "))

#     counter += 1
